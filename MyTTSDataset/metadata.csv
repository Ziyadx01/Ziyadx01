wavs/01.wav|Alif-Lam-Mi This is the book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah, who believe in the unseen, established prayer, and spend of what we have provided for them.
wavs/02.wav|for them, and who believe in what has been revealed to you, O Muhammad, and what has been revealed before you, and of the hereafter, they are certain in faith. Those are upon right guidance from their Lord and Master.
wavs/03.wav|and it is those who are the successful. Indeed, those who disbelieve, it is all the same for them. Whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe. Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their minds.
wavs/04.wav|upon their hearing and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment. And of the people are some who say, we believe in Allah and the last day, but they are not believers. They think to deceive us.
wavs/05.wav|Allah and those who believe but they deceive not except themselves and perceive it not. In their hearts is disease so Allah has increased their disease and for them is a painful punishment
wavs/06.wav|because they habitually used to lie and when it is said to them do not cause corruption on the earth they say we are but reformers unquestionably it is they who are the ones who are wrong
wavs/07.wav|corruptors but they perceive it not and when it is said to them believe as the people have believed they say should we believe as the foolish have believed unquestionably it is they who are the foolish
wavs/08.wav|but they know it not. And when they meet those who believe, they say, we believe. But when they're alone with their evil ones, they say, indeed, we are with you, we were also with you.
wavs/09.wav|only mockers. But Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression while they wander blindly. Those are the ones who have purchased error in exchange for goodness.
wavs/10.wav|guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided. Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around them, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness.
wavs/11.wav|in darkness so they could not see. Deaf, dumb, and blind so they will not return to the right path. Or it's like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder, and lightning.
wavs/12.wav|They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death But Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers the lightning almost snatches away
wavs/13.wav|their sight every time it lights the way for them they walk therein but when darkness comes over them they stand still and if Allah had willed he could have taken away their hearing and their sight
wavs/14.wav|Indeed, Allah is over all things competent. O mankind, worship your Lord who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous. He who made for you
wavs/15.wav|for you the earth a bed and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So do not attribute to Allah equals while you know.
wavs/16.wav|And if you're in doubt about what we have sent down upon our servant, Muhammad, then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah if you should believe.
wavs/17.wav|law if you should be truthful, and if you do not, and you will never be able to, then fear the fire whose fuel is meant and stones prepared for the disbelievers. And give thanks to the Lord.
wavs/18.wav|good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds, that they will have gardens and paradise beneath which rivers flow. Wherever they are provided with the provision of fruit therewith, they will say, this is what we have in store for you.
wavs/19.wav|were provided with before and it gives to them in likeness and they will have therein purified spouses and they will abide therein eternally." Indeed Allah is not temporary.
wavs/20.wav|to present an example that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it and those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord but as for those who disbelieve they say what did Allah intend for us?
wavs/21.wav|by this is an example he misleads many thereby and guides many thereby and he misleads not except the defiantly disobedient who break the covenant of a lot after contracting it and sever that covenant
wavs/22.wav|which Allah has ordered to be joined and caused corruption on earth. It is those who are the losers. How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and he brought you to life?
wavs/23.wav|life. Then he will cause you to die, then he will bring you back to life, and then to him you will be returned. It is he who created for you all that is on earth, then he directs you to him.
wavs/24.wav|himself to the heavens and made them seven heavens and he is knowing of all things. And mention, O Muhammad, when your Lord said to the angels, indeed I will make upon the earth its excessive authority, they said, will you place it upon the earth?
wavs/25.wav|upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood while we declare your praise and sanctify you Allah said indeed I know that which you do not know and he taught Adam the names of all things
wavs/26.wav|Then He showed them to the angels and said, inform me of the names of these. If you are truthful, they said, exalted are you, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Indeed, it is you who is the knowing, the wise. He said,
wavs/27.wav|then Adam informed them of their names. And when he had informed them of their names, he said, did I not tell you that I know the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth and I know what you reveal and what you have concealed? And mention what you have revealed.
wavs/28.wav|when he said to the angels prostrate before Adam so they prostrated except for Iblis he refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers and we said Oh Adam dwell you and your people
wavs/29.wav|wife in paradise and eat therefrom in ease and abundance from wherever you will but do not approach this tree lest you be among the wrongdoers but saying cause them to slip out of it
wavs/30.wav|and removed them from that condition in which they had been. And we said, go down all of you as enemies to one another and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time. Then we said,
wavs/31.wav|Then Adam received from his Lord some words, and he accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is he who is the accepting of repentance, the merciful." We said, go down from it, all of you, and when guidance comes to you from God.
wavs/32.wav|me, whoever follows my guidance, there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve. And those who disbelieve and deny our signs, those will be the companions of the Father."
